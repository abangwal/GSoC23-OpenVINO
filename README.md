This repository hosts the code for training models for the GSoC23 project ["Industrial Meter Reading with OpenVINO"](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/3eKcuFkd), which is implemented under Intel's [OpenVINO Toolkit](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit) organization.

## About the project

The project is divided into two parts. In the first part of the project we created a Deep learning based solution to read Industrial meters, with the process of detection and segmentation, along with inference with OpenVINO.
In the part two of the project we further optimize the solution pipeline to support multiple camera input with OpenVINO-toolkit, along with a web-based GUI with HTML,CSS,JS and Flask web-framework.
